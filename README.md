# past-projets

This repository shows my past work completed during advanced computer science courses and internships. <br />

**1 - NeuralNetwork.py and RegressionTree.py** were my first models completed during my first internship. These models were meant to 1) predict crop yield
outcomes according to nutrients and pH and 2) help the startup experiment with machine learning models. The regression tree is the appropriate option for this analysis. <br /><br />
**2 - Web Scraping for Real Estate Listings Validation.py** is a web scraper that uses the BeautifulSoup library to validate if a certain list of real estate
listings or "opportunities" have been posted to Zumper.com. <br /> <br />
**3- Data Engineering** folder contains my creations and code improvements to orchestration scripts and Big Data Pipelines in Azure DevOps during my internship in a Data Engineering department. <br /><br />
**4 - Sentiment Classification with Logistic Regression - Preprocessing.py** is a logistic regression model used to make binary sentiment classification on movie reviews.
This was done in the context of my **COMP 550 - Natural Language Processing** class. The objective of this assignment was to learn about the best NLP pre-processing
decisions and not about maximizing the accuracy of the model.  <br />

**5 - French CYK and Tree.py** is an implementation of the Cocke–Younger–Kasami algorithm (CYK) on a simplified french context-free grammar (french-grammar.txt and french-grammar - readable.txt). The file deconstructs a french sentence into Part-of-Speech tags and prints a tree according to the grammar rules. This was undertaken in the context of my COMP 550 - Natural Language Processing class. <br />

**6 - NLP-Final-Project** is a folder containing the files that were used to perform medical abbreviation disambiguation for my team final project in the context of my **COMP 550 - Natural Language Processing** class. Logistic regression, neural network, SVM and random forest models were implemented to disambiguate (give the correct expansion) of medical abbreviations in clinical notes. The logistic regression acheived 81.68% F1 score in the testing set. Please see more details in the project report. <br />

**7 - Decision Tree and KNN** is a folder containing the notebook and report of a machine learning assignment where we had to use a decision tree and a KNN algorithm to predict survival and diagnosis with medical data. This was undertaken in the context of my COMP **551 - Applied Machine Learning** class.   

**8 - Spotify Class Prediction** is an exploration of using neural networks to predict the category of a song according to Spotify data. This was done in the context of my **INSY 463 Deep Learning for Business Analytics** class. 

**More machine learning and forecasting projects to come.**
