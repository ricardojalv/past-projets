# past-projets

This repository shows my past work completed during advanced computer science courses and internships. 

1 - NeuralNetwork.py and RegressionTree.py were my first models completed during my first internship. These models were meant to 1) predict crop yield 
outcomes according to nutrients and pH and 2) experiment with machine learning models. The regression tree is the appropriate option for this analysis. 
2 - Web Scraping for Real Estate Listings Validation.py is a web scraper that uses the BeautifulSoup library to validate if a certain list of real estate
listings or "opportunities" have been posted to Zumper.com.
3- 
4 - Sentiment Classification with Logistic Regression - Preprocessing.py is a logistic regression model used to make binary sentiment classification on movie reviews. 
This was done in the context of my COMP 550 - Natural Language Processing class. The objective of this assignment was about learning about the best NLP pre-processing 
decisions and not about maximizing the accuracy of the model.
